## Business Objectives :
### Objective 1
#### An analysis of the engagement data for the month of May across 2017 and 2018
### Objective 2
#### A projection of May 2019 engagements
---
## Findings : 
### It was concluded that, in May 2017, engagements reach the peak as the week approaches the 4th day. This suggests midweek is the most effective period for driving user interaction.
## Additionally, it was concluded that in May 2018 engagements reach the peak as the week approaches the 4th and 5th day.
---
## Recommendation : Launch key promotions and features on Day 4 to maximize engagement, and introduce light weekend activities to reduce drop-off.
## Potential : Take advantage of higher midweek activity to smoothly transition users into weekend promotions and keep them engaged.
---
## Risks :
### Relying heavily on Day 4 promotions risks poor performance if midweek user activitydrops unexpectedly.

### Weekend promotions may result in lower user interest if the content doesn’t connectwith the audience.
---
## Forecast :

### Engagement Forecast- 2019
#### The forecast is calculated based on the Year-over-year (YoY) growth percentage calculated between 2017 and 2018.
### Built a Power BI forecast model projecting a peak of 27M engagements for the upcoming year — a 23%–50% increase from previous highs(18M and 22M).
